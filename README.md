# A ME WEBSITE
### When an astrophysic lover ended up in a software programming course at university, this happens to happen. 
It is just a half casual half professional personal website where I included all my different moods and interests. 
The background music are soundtracks by HoYo-Mix or MiHoYo in my favourite game called Genshin Impact.
Feel free to view it.
