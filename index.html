                            <h4>[Slide 1/3] - Astrophysics</h4><br>
                            <p>I once pursued in astrophysics. Mostly because of all the formulas and my favorite physicist - Stephen Hawking. Pursued until the point of wanting to be an astrophysicist. Yet here I am making and completing my own personal website, because of some personal reason, or reasons. To others, astrophysics is a rare career or even unusual to take as a permenant job. People said: "Nah, you can't never get a job.", "No, the future needs IT-based employees.", "You need to think between money and interest.", and so on. The first day I enrolled in a Software Engineering diploma course, I promised myself, not just any angry or sad promise, but a neutral and strong promise, that I must and I will use my skills and knowledge in Software Engineering to get a job, either well-paid or under-paid, as long as there is a monthly salary, I will use my own savings for my longed astrophysics course. This is the path I paved for myself since that very day and nothing is going to destroy it, even if I am 40-50 years old. Why settle down when you have more to pursue and achieve? </p>

                            <p>To be frank, or as you can see, I love objects that exist in space. Silent, dangerous, yet heavenly. I think of astronomy is the field where I can find my life purpose. I don't have a mind of businessman, nor a skill of marketing, nor a voice of influencer. You might tell me that I can learn or study those skills, but it is where interest wins. One can't fold a twig like paper, because twig has "twig" properties while paper has its. I am curious and want to know the answer of every unsolved questions or problems of space or even time. Sounds ridiculous? It may be but there are more ridiculous things going on when you look into the dark abyss of space. I will keep thinking and pondering until my last day that I stop asking why. That's me, the true me.</p>

                            <p>Astrophysics, checked. Astronomy, checked. Astrology, yes! Also checked. Astrology is just a little weird past-time activity for me when I was in secondary school. I used to print out all relevant information about the horoscopes and be an astrologist in my class when there is no teacher around. Why? Because it is fun to start a chat with friends in a weird manner. Not to be superstitious, but there is a game I was and am still playing, I drew my first character who is an astrologist. And I was a 10% astrologist once. You get what I mean. Uh... Anyways, astrology is just travel guide in life like all religions do while we are the one who controls and decides the direction of the steering wheel.</p>

                            <h4>[Slide 1/5] - Time Management</h4><br>
                            <p>Before I went to university, I don't have any time management. Literally no sense of time, deadline or whatsoever. Everything is a rush for me. Then, when I started my university "life" (staying at home mostly because of pandemic), I tried to arrange my time for all the courses, assignments, exercise, tutorials etc. I found that if I managed my time properly, I have more time to other things or maybe finishing assignment one or two week earlier prior to deadline. Since that very first time I managed my time, I spent 30 minutes every morning before getting out from bed to think about the schedule today. What should I do? Which is important and closer to due date? Constructing a flexible timetable in my mind every morning, slowly completing all the overwhelming assignments I have.</p>

                            <p>Speaking of efficiency, I can confidently say that I have the efficiency to complete my work in time or even have one or two weeks of debugging and checking. When I get an assigned task which I am in charge of (because we should follow the person in charge), I tend to go straight into it or latest by tomorrow. If the task is completed earlier, then there is more time to check and fix all the problems arise later. Of course, quality of the task is also a must. Procrastinating is not my working style as I chose to work fast and strike hard.</p>

                            <p>Yeah, about stress. The first time I started to like stress is that one time when one of my lecturers, Ms. Abbhirami, evaluted my very-badly-done assignment. I thought I did a good work but eventually I did the worst one. That day, I was stressed out and panicked that my grade won't be as I wanted. I scrambled for university assignment example, what should I do, how to execute it, finding all references, writing citation etc. The next day, I resubmitted my assignment for Ms.Abbhirami for checking, surprisely she commented well done as per my abilites in her class. From that day, instead of kicking out stress, I started to welcome stress and live with it as for it helps me a lot. However, I do need to control my temper when I get stressed, that I need to think positively and straight to avoid conflicts. Still working on it and getting better.</p>

                            <p>Teamwork makes the dream works. Heard it very often, right? Well, it depends. You need a visionary leader with responsible colleagues. The leader should plan every step before and discuss with the team, not just leader gets to do the decision. For me personally, I am a steward-style leader. At first, I will try to be as neutral as possible, giving my opinions and suggestion while listening to my colleagues'. I will give my trust to my colleagues and their skills, unless they decided to abuse it. I usually work with my colleagues in a moderate environment, not too relax yet not too hectic. Of course not when the deadline is near. Small deadline to complete assigned tasks is given out in order to let us stay in the comfort zone where we can still complete our assignment while enjoying ourselves a little. Communication between colleagues is also very important to me as we need to know each other and our abilities that can benefit our team. Being in a team to complete and achieve something is better than getting a trophy on my own.</p>

                            <p>Balanced as all things should be. Sounds familiar? No? Nevermind that. I do believe working as an employee in the day and unwind myself at night is crucial for me. Although I once worked as an office boy, but still I lack of the real working experience. However, right now, everyday, I balance myself in terms of academic and entertainment. Morning until evening, I will focus on my courses, studies, assignment and etc. Night, I will get in a call with my friends, play games or just a chat. I always use myself as a test subject to get the lifestyle suitable for me and this balanced lifestyle I am and still having, allows me to perform better and better each day. Equilibrium is the key to deliver and present the best from me.</p>

                            <p>This picture of our taekwando club was taken after a competition in Melaka and the second competiton I ever participated, if not mistaken, 4 years ago (I was standing behind in the photo). It was a long day as I waited and waited for my turn because heavyweight category always placed at the end of the schedule. But it was one of my best days before this Covid pandemic. IT WAS TAEKWANDO PEOPLE! where you can fight and hit others legally. Just joking, it is a martial art for discipline and self-defense, we don't condone violence here.  Training, sparring, trolling with friends, participating taekwando competitions with friends and cheering for them, how nice. All I can say is just THE GOOD OLD DAYZ...</p>

There isn't much to talk about my badminton. It is just a hobby and one of my favourite sports. That's all I can say. If the time, the venue, the people are met, I am always ready for a badminton match.</p>

                            <p>I started workout mostly because of some action movie fighting scene and also I learnt taekwando. It does have some connection like for instance, I need to jump higher which allows me to do more aerial kicks, need core and waist strength to twist and turn faster. Yeah, to be honest, it's weird when I think of it. Recreating movie stuffs ha! To think positively, I get to move my hands and legs instead of sitting in my sofa everyday. And sweat. You know is the kind of motivation where the protagonist did some cool and seems-like-doable-but-no combos or fighting styles that get you to start working out. That's what motivates me. Oh yes and epic soundtracks like Man of Steel, listen during workout. It helps a lot.</p>

                            <p>Yup, that's me. You might be wondering what am I holding. It is a bassoon, an instrument from the woodwind family and you might not want to know its Italian name. I took bassoon in secondary school when I joined the symphony orchestra society. Initially, I chose the cello, but my coach told me to learn bassoon as cello section is full. Then, I started to like this instrument, its deep and elderly sound, yet able to play high notes. It's a passion I kept since that day where I finally and legitimately learnt an instrument. Even though I am not very good at it (mostly because I didn't practice a lot), but I still love to play it. Let me boast a bit, I did get a one-to-one session with a professional bassonist, Alexandar Lenkov, when our school symphony orchestra invited Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra to give us a workshop. Memorable.</p>

Besides that, all my favourite and mentioned sports, I also know some football (goalkeeper only, sadly), some basketball, swimming, archery, table tennis, cycling, frisbee. That's all I can think of. I just like to get out and go physical. So, if there is any chances I can go out after this pandemic (probably after five years, to be positive? I don't know), I will definitely call my friends and never-hangout-before university colleagues to play some sports together. Let's just wait and see...</p>

                            <p>AHEM! It's game time. As you can see and hear, the record disc image and the background music for my website, is from a game by miHoYo called Genshin Impact released in 2020 (Don't copystrike me please...). The game that I got my astrology character mentioned, Mona. I love this game and I can say that it is part of my life now. I know every resources of the in-game map like I know my hometown or even better. Firstly, it is a story-based game. Secondlu, it has beautiful, dramactic, emotional, and epic music. Thirdly, it has a lot of events to keep me busy and not get bored in terms of playing game. It is hard for me to describe Genshin Impact as it is too overwhelming. It's like you are living in another virtual world where you can walk, run, swim, fishing, ride a boat, build a house, hangout with in-game characters like you do with friends, fight etc. You name it you can do it in Genshin Impact. The best game I ever played and will remain as it is in my life. Nothing is going to replace it.</p><br>
                            <p>P/S: I am a veteran player. If you need help or guide, I can do my best to help.</p>

                            <p>For gamers, you will know this game because it is another game released by miHoYo in 2016. It is also a story-based game but there are only female characters. Yeah, only female characters. Anyways, the story behind every characters in Honkai Impact 3 is very interesting and like a drama you will keep chasing for answer. I used to hate story-based game and play games like League of Legends, the kind of game that you need skills, reaction time and a lot of practices to be good at it. But then, I realised that I didn't play as much as my friends did, so I just gave up on all the game that required skills and changed to story-based game which I started to play Honkai Impact 3. Not that I like to give up, but I don't have and won't have the skills as my age are getting higher compared to all professional gamer who started gaming since 13-15 years old. I am still half a gamer myself, though.</p>

                            <p>Well, it is basically League of Legends, but requires less skill to play if you compare a mobile game to a computer game. However, I won't play it everyday because it is very neutral to me. I will play when I am bored but not for a long period or with my friends. The more the merrier. Actually, it is just excuse to chat with my friends and laugh together. Win and lose doesn't matter (sometimes does) as long as I played with friends.</p><br>
                            <p>P/S: And I support every game from Riot like I support every game from miHoYo and Supercell (next slide), although I don't have time and energy to play all of their games.</p>

Brawl Stars and Everdale are the game I still playing, but again with friends. The officials announced that there will be three new games: Clash Mini, Clash Quest, and Clash Heros. Sadly, it is still the Beta. The main point is to enjoy games with friends. Yes, I said this a lot, but it is the truth, you can't deny it. Unless one is an introvert.</p>
